## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to easily design and export email templates with an email editor.

How It Works
1. Open any email editor (e.g., this demo editor).
2. Select a text element within the email template.
3. Modify its properties using the sidebar options (e.g., font size, color, alignment).
4. Click the "Export HTML" button to generate the final email-ready HTML.
5. This approach streamlines email template creation, making designing and customizing responsive emails easier!

## Installations

You need to have Node.js installed before using Cypress.

For rest of the installations move to project folder in command prompt and type

`npm install`

which will install Cypress and other supporting tools

## To run the tests

Once installations are done open up the terminal and run the following command to execute the test in headless mode

'npx cypress run'

To open up the cypress test runner run the following command

'npx cypress open'

Once the test runner opens up, choose e2e testing and select a browser to run the tests. Once you see the spec file 'test.cy.js' simple click on the file to start live test execution on the cypress test runner
